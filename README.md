# Library Quest

Track your library cards.

## Did You Know

* If you live in California, you can get a library card from many different cities -- even if you are not a resident of that city!
* Many local libraries are part of larger library networks, such as [Marinet](https://marinet.lib.ca.us/). 
* Apps like [Libby](https://libbyapp.com) can be connected to many library cards at once, giving you instant access to all of their ebook and audiobook collections, all in one place!

## What Is This

Library Quest aims to be a place where you can track your library cards, see what libraries your card gives you access to, and find new libraries to visit!
